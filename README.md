## Major Projects

#### Identify all GSA websites

* The initial identification of GSA websites will be via [pulse.cio.gov](https://pulse.cio.gov/).

#### Locate the privacy policies for all GSA websites

* The Privacy Office is developing a Digital Analytics Platform search capability to identify potential privacy policy pages on GSA websites.  These site will be added to the [Privacy Page list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b3MhQp_OSDZZfxCd-0iiwv6ys-vzV5xnsDMzUdvHhSQ/edit#gid=0).

#### Identify points of contact for the privacy policies of all GSA websites

* After identifying GSA websites, the Privacy Office will contact domain admins and/or site owners and offer the opportunity to enroll in a Google group.

#### Engage with the points of contact and collaborate together.  

* Once appropriate POCs are located, we will share knowledge, best practices and update pages together.
