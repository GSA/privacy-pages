Here's a proposed outline for this project - 



Generate: 
* list of websites 
* list of privacy pages 
* list of points of contact for all of these - at least at the per domain 

Then: 
* ping the websites without pages and saying - we need to do a page and/or redirect to the gsa or other page 
  * identify a model policy page to share

Then: 
Scan existing privacy pages and:
1) reach out individually to horrible examples 
2) send some bullet points to everyone with best case examples 



* pinging these folks with an ask:  
  *  Conduct a sel-assessment using this guide and tool....

Goals:
* everything has an up-to-date privacy policy page 
* the site owner reviews the policy annually and makes updates as needed.
