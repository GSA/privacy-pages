Here's a proposed outline for this project - 



Generate: 
* [list of websites](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b3MhQp_OSDZZfxCd-0iiwv6ys-vzV5xnsDMzUdvHhSQ/edit#gid=0)
* [list of privacy pages](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b3MhQp_OSDZZfxCd-0iiwv6ys-vzV5xnsDMzUdvHhSQ/edit#gid=0)
* [list of points of contact for all of these - at least at the per domain](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b3MhQp_OSDZZfxCd-0iiwv6ys-vzV5xnsDMzUdvHhSQ/edit#gid=0)
* [Google Group for coordinating the privacy policy points of contact](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/#!forum/privacy-policy-poc)

Then: 
* ping the websites without pages and saying - we need to do a page and/or redirect to the gsa or other page 
  * identify a model policy page to share

Then: 
Scan existing privacy pages and:
1) reach out individually to horrible examples 
2) send some bullet points to everyone with best case examples 



* pinging these folks with an ask:  
  *  Conduct a sel-assessment using this guide and tool....

Goals:
* everything has an up-to-date privacy policy page 
* the site owner reviews the policy annually and makes updates as needed.
