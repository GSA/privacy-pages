## Confirming the website POC

Hi!  

We're working with all of the website owners across GSA to better collaborate on a small but important part of our web presence - the privacy policies of our websites.  

To that end, we want to make sure that each website:  
* Has a privacy policy page 
* That the privacy policy page can be found at example.gov/privacy 
* That there's an identified point of contact for the website that is responsible for the website's privacy policy page and with whom we can coordinate any updates to the privacy page in the future, as needed.  
* That the point of contact is added to the [GSA Privacy Policy Points of Contact Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/#!forum/privacy-policy-poc).

We see that Challenge.gov has a privacy policy page at https://www.challenge.gov/privacy-policy.  

However, it appears that challenge.gov/privacy does not redirect, as it needs to.  This is a small but worthwhile change that we need to make.  Are you able to have that set up and reply back to me when it's done?  In this case, it appears that challenge.gov/privacy resolves to https://www.challenge.gov/agency/privacy-and-civil-liberties-oversight-board/.  Are you able to work with the website team to change that redirect?  

For Challenge.gov, are you still the best point of contact for the website?  If not, who would be?  

We'll then want to add you or the best point of contact to the [GSA Privacy Policy Points of Contact Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/#!forum/privacy-policy-poc).  The group won't have much traffic but will be an important means by which we can collaborate on privacy policy pages in the future.

Thanks!

We don't know which GSA office owns the website https://www.api.gov/privacy.  

Are you the best point of contact for the website?  If not, who would be?  

We'll then want to add you or the best point of contact to the [GSA Privacy Policy Points of Contact Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/#!forum/privacy-policy-poc).  The group won't have much traffic but will be an important means by which we can collaborate on privacy policy pages in the future.

We see that api.gov does not have a privacy policy page at https://www.api.gov/privacy.  

This is a small but worthwhile change that we need to make.  Are you able to have that set up and reply to confirm when it's done?

It appears that _________.gov/privacy does not resolve.  This is a small but worthwhile change that we need to make.  Are you able to have that set up and reply back to me when it's done?
