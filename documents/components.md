##### Information Collected and Stored Automatically  

What information is collected by default?  Examples include but are not limited to Internet Protocol (IP) address, Browser type and version, operating system, referrer address (i.e. the page that linked you to this one), your browser's human language settings, etc.

<i>Example:</i>  We collect and temporarily store certain information about your visit for use in site management and security purposes only. We collect and analyze this information because it helps us to better design our website to suit your needs. We may also automatically collect information about the web content you view in the event of a known security or virus threat. This information includes:

1. The Internet domain from which you access our website (for example, “xcompany.com” if you use a private Internet access account, or “yourschool.edu” if you connect from an educational domain); <i>Open question - is this a reference to reverse DNS lookup? Or is this based on other datasets connecting IP addresses to their owners?</i>

2. The Internet Protocol (IP) address (a unique number for each computer connected to the Internet) from which you access our website;

3. The type of browser (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome) used to access our site;

We may share the above information with our employees or representatives with a “need-to-know” in the performance of their official duties, other Federal agencies, or other named representatives as needed to quickly process your request or transaction. This information is only used to help us make our site more useful for you. Raw data logs are retained temporarily as required for security and site management purposes only.

<i>Example:</i> Website Analytics Tools:
These tools collect basic site usage information such as: how many visits HealthCare.gov receives, the pages visited by consumers, time spent on the site, the number of return visits to the site, the approximate location of the device used to access the site, types of devices used, etc. This information is then used to maintain the website including: monitoring site stability, measuring site traffic, optimizing site content, and improving the consumer experience. Use the HealthCare.gov privacy manager to opt-out of website analytics tools.

Digital Advertising Tools for Outreach and Education:
CMS uses third-party tools to support our digital advertising outreach and education efforts. These tools enable CMS to reach new people and provide information to previous visitors. In order to use these tools, we use the following technologies on HealthCare.gov.

Click Tracking – CMS uses click tracking to identify the ads that are most helpful to consumers and efficient for outreach. This enables CMS to improve the performance of ads that consumers click on. When users click on links from ads, data about what ad was viewed is collected. Reports are generated about ad performance – including the total number of views and clicks an ad received.

Conversion Tracking - CMS uses conversion tracking to identify ads that are helpful to consumers and efficient for outreach. It enables CMS to improve the performance of ads viewed by consumers. When a HealthCare.gov ad is viewed on a third-party site (e.g. a banner ad), a cookie is placed in the browser of the device the ad was viewed on. If this device later visits HealthCare.gov, the visit is linked to the ad viewed on the same device. Use the HealthCare.gov privacy manager to opt-out of advertising tools. Users can click on the “AdChoices” Icon in the corner of our Ads to opt-out of this Ad Targeting. Users who have set their browser to “Do Not Track” will automatically be opt-ed out of conversion tracking. For more information about AdChoices and Do Not Track, see “Your Choices about tracking and Data Collection”

Re-targeting - CMS uses retargeting to provide information to consumers who have previously visited HeathCare.gov such as reminders about upcoming enrollment deadlines. Retargeting enables CMS to improve the performance of ads by delivering them to relevant audiences such as recent visitors to HealthCare.gov. During a visit to HealthCare.gov, a cookie is placed in the browser of the devices used to view the site. When that same device is used to visit third-party sites that are displaying HealthCare.gov ads, ads for HealthCare.gov may be shown to that device because it had previously visited HealthCare.gov. Using these cookies, CMS does not collect information about the third-party sites visited by a device. Reports are generated about ad performance – including the total number of views and clicks an ad received. Use the HealthCare.gov privacy manager to opt-out of advertising tools. Users can click on the “AdChoices” Icon in the corner of our Ads to opt-out of this Ad Targeting. Users who have set their browser to “Do Not Track” will automatically be opt-ed out of conversion tracking. For more information about AdChoices and Do Not Track, see Your Choices about Tracking and Data Collection.

Targeted Advertising - CMS uses third-party vendors to engage in targeted advertising (also known as online behavioral or interest-based advertising) to provide information to consumers across their online activities. Targeted advertising involves the collection of data from a particular computer or device. Data regarding web viewing behaviors or application use is gathered to predict user preferences or interests. CMS can have ads delivered to computers or devices based on the preferences or interests inferred from the web viewing behaviors or application use.

Third-party vendors engaged by CMS may also target advertising based on information automatically collected (not information you provide) when you browse the CMS websites or other websites on the internet. You can opt out this type of data collection via our Privacy Manager, Ad Choices, and Do Not Track. See Your Choices about Tracking and Data Collection above for methods to opt out of this type of collection.

###### Third Party Services

<i>Example:</i> This website employs third party services (e.g. analytical tools - Google Analytics, NewRelic; survey tools - ForeSee; A/B tests - Optimilzely). These services require your device to make live connections to third parties when you visit this site and the categories of information described above in "Information Collected and Stored Automatically" about your visit are generally disclosed to those third parties.    

CMS may consider new third-party tools or the use of new third-party websites, but CMS will first assess the tools or websites before it is used in connection with HealthCare.gov. CMS will provide notice to the public before adding any new tool to HealthCare.gov. These assessments include a description about how information will be collected, accessed, secured, and stored. See a list of the third-party tools currently being used on HealthCare.gov. Risk assessments for third-party websites and applications are available at https://www.hhs.gov/pia/. 

##### If You Choose to Send Us Personal Information

<i>Example:</i>  Some parts of our website let you voluntarily provide personal information, such as your name or e-mail address. For example, you can provide us with your contact information to sign up for e-mail alerts or to post comments to our blog. We do not collect this information when you visit our website unless you choose to provide it to us. When you provide it to us, we only use it for the purposes of communicating with you, furthering our consumer protection activities, and providing information you request.


##### Sharing of Your Information

<i>Example:</i> If you choose to provide personal information, you are consenting to the CFTC’s use of that information and allowing the information to be shared with CFTC employees and contractors to conduct official business. Such employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality restrictions to protect your personal information. Your information will only be used to perform official business for which it was collected and for other uses compatible with the purposes for which it was collected. For example:

When you choose to provide information to the CFTC by email, voicemail, through the CFTC websites or other means, you are consenting to the CFTC using the information provided therein, including PII, in accordance with this notice and the applicable Privacy Act of 1974 system of records notices.

Under certain circumstances, the CFTC may be required by law to disclose information you submit to other authorities for official purposes, for example, to respond to a Congressional inquiry or subpoena.

Your personal information will be protected from misuse while in the possession of the CFTC. Management, operational and technical controls are in place with the goal of ensuring the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the PII. If a potential incident or incident is suspected or confirmed involving the loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information and would likely result in substantial harm to individuals, CFTC will endeavor to contact all affected parties in a timely manner, unless doing so would pose risks to the investigation of the potential incident or incident. The CFTC will work to ensure that swift and appropriate action is taken to mitigate risks.

##### Security

<i>Example:</i> We take precautions to maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the information we collect at this site. Such measures include access controls designed to limit access to the information to the extent necessary to accomplish our mission. We also employ various security technologies to protect the information stored on our systems. We routinely test our security measures to ensure that they remain operational and effective.

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs commercial software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.

Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.

##### Intrusion Detection Monitoring and US-CERT EINSTEIN Program

Does your site rely upon a DHS provided trusted internet connection TIC and the EINSTEIN program?

<i>Example:</i> The CFTC uses software programs to monitor this website for security purposes to ensure it remains available to all users and to protect information in the system. By accessing our websites, you are expressly consenting to these monitoring activities. Unauthorized attempts to defeat or circumvent security features; to use the system for other than intended purposes; to deny service to authorized users; to access, obtain, alter, damage, or to destroy information; or otherwise to interfere with the system or its operation are prohibited. Evidence of such acts may be disclosed to law enforcement authorities and result in criminal prosecution under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996, 18 USC 1030, or other applicable criminal laws. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits.

The CFTC’s information systems also are protected by EINSTEIN cybersecurity capabilities, under the operational control of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). Electronic communications with the CFTC may be scanned by government-owned or contractor equipment to look for network traffic indicating known or suspected malicious cyber activity, including malicious content or communications.  Electronic communications within CFTC will be collected or retained by US-CERT only if they are associated with known or suspected cyber threats.  US-CERT will use the information collected through EINSTEIN to analyze the known or suspected cyber threat and help the CFTC and other agencies respond and better protect their computers and networks. For additional information about EINSTEIN capabilities, please see the EINSTEIN program-related Privacy Impact Assessments available on the DHS cybersecurity privacy website along with other information about the federal government’s cybersecurity activities. See, for example, The EINSTEIN Program and DHS Privacy & FOIA Reports.
