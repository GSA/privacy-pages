### [OMB M-10-22 Section 3](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-22.pdf)

*  Agencies may use web measurement and customization technologies for the purpose of improving Federal services online through conducting measurement and analysis of usage or through customization of the user’s experience.
* Under no circumstances may agencies use such technologies:
  * to track user individual-level activity on the Internet outside of the website or application from which the technology originates;
  * to share the data obtained through such technologies, without the user’s explicit consent, with other departments or agencies;
  * to cross-reference, without the user’s explicit consent, any data gathered from web measurement and customization technologies against PII to determine individual-level online activity;  
  * to collect PII without the user’s explicit consent in any fashion; or   
  * for any like usages so designated by OMB.  
  
* Tiers of technologies:

  * Tier 1 – single session. This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization technologies.
  * Tier 2 – multi-session without PII. This tier encompasses any use of multisession web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected (including when the agency is unable to identify an individual as a result
of its use of such technologies).
  * Tier 3 – multi-session with PII. This tier encompasses any use of multi-session web measurement and customization technologies when PII is collected (including when the agency is able to identify an individual as a result of its use of such technologies). 

* Federal agencies using web measurement and customization technologies in a manner subject to Tier 1 or Tier 2 are authorized to use such technologies so long as the agencies (1) are in compliance with this Memorandum and all other relevant policies; (2) provide clear and conspicuous notice in their online Privacy Policy citing the use of such technologies, as specified in Attachment 3; and (3) comply
with their internal policies governing the use of such technologies.
* Privacy Office Review. Any proposals by the agency to engage in Tier 3 uses must be reviewed by the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP).

* Notice and Comment. Following SAOP review, for new proposals of Tier 3 uses or substantive changes to existing uses of such technologies, agencies must: 
  * Solicit comment through their Open Government Webpage at www.[agency].gov/open for a minimum of 30 days. This notice and comment
must include the agency’s proposal to use such technologies and a description of how they will be used, which should at a minimum address the items in the Privacy Policy as described in Attachment 3; and
  * Review and consider substantive comments and make changes to their intended use of web measurement and customization technologies where appropriate. 

### [OMB M-10-23 Section 3](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-23.pdf)

* When using a third-party website or application, agencies should adhere to the following
general requirements:
  * Third-Party Privacy Policies. Before an agency uses any third-party website or application to engage with the public, the agency should examine the third party’s privacy policy to evaluate the risks and determine whether the website or application
is appropriate for the agency’s use. In addition, the agency should monitor any changes to the third party’s privacy policy and periodically reassess the risks.
  * External Links. If an agency posts a link that leads to a third-party website or any other location that is not part of an official government domain, the agency should provide an alert to the visitor, such as a statement adjacent to the link or a “pop-up,”
explaining that visitors are being directed to a nongovernment website that may have different privacy policies from those of the agency’s official website.
  * Embedded Applications. If an agency incorporates or embeds a third-party application on its website or any other official government domain, the agency should take the necessary steps to disclose the third party’s involvement and describe the agency’s activities in its Privacy Policy, as specified in this Memorandum. 
  * Agency Branding. In general, when an agency uses a third-party website or application that is not part of an official government domain, the agency should apply appropriate branding to distinguish the agency’s activities from those of
nongovernment actors. For example, to the extent practicable, an agency should add its seal or emblem to its profile page on a social media website to indicate that it is an official agency presence.
  * Information Collection. If information is collected through an agency’s use of a third-party website or application, the agency should collect only the information “necessary for the proper performance of agency functions and which has practical utility.” If personally identifiable information (PII) is collected, the agency should collect only the minimum necessary to accomplish a purpose required by statute, regulation, or executive order.

### Section 4:

* The adapted PIA is required whenever an agency’s use of a third-party website or application makes PII available to the agency. Each adapted PIA should be tailored to address the specific functions of the website or application, but adapted PIAs need not be more elaborate than the agency’s other PIAs. In general, each PIA should be posted on the agency’s official website.
The PIA should describe:  
i. the specific purpose of the agency’s use of the third-party website or
application;  
ii. any PII that is likely to become available to the agency through public use
of the third-party website or application;  
iii. the agency’s intended or expected use of PII;  
iv. with whom the agency will share PII;   
v. whether and how the agency will maintain PII, and for how long;  
vi. how the agency will secure PII that it uses or maintains;  
vii. what other privacy risks exist and how the agency will mitigate those
risks; and . 
viii. whether the agency’s activities will create or modify a “system of records”
under the Privacy Act.
