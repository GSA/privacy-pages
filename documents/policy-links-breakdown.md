#### [OMB M-10-22 Section 3] (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-22.pdf)

*  Agencies may use web measurement and customization technologies for the purpose of improving Federal services online through conducting measurement and analysis of usage or through customization of the user’s experience.
* Under no circumstances may agencies use such technologies:
** to track user individual-level activity on the Internet outside of the website or application from which the technology originates;
** to share the data obtained through such technologies, without the user’s explicit consent, with other departments or agencies;
** to cross-reference, without the user’s explicit consent, any data gathered from web measurement and customization technologies against PII to determine individual-level online activity;
** to collect PII without the user’s explicit consent in any fashion; or
** for any like usages so designated by OMB. 

* Tiers of technologies:

** Tier 1 – single session. This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization technologies.
** Tier 2 – multi-session without PII. This tier encompasses any use of multisession web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected (including when the agency is unable to identify an individual as a result
of its use of such technologies).
** Tier 3 – multi-session with PII. This tier encompasses any use of multi-session web measurement and customization technologies when PII is collected (including when the agency is able to identify an individual as a result of its use of such technologies). 

* Federal agencies using web measurement and customization technologies in a manner subject to Tier 1 or Tier 2 are authorized to use such technologies so long as the agencies (1) are in compliance with this Memorandum and all other relevant policies; (2) provide clear and conspicuous notice in their online Privacy Policy citing the use of such technologies, as specified in Attachment 3; and (3) comply
with their internal policies governing the use of such technologies.
* Privacy Office Review. Any proposals by the agency to engage in Tier 3 uses must be reviewed by the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP).

* Notice and Comment. Following SAOP review, for new proposals of Tier 3 uses or substantive changes to existing uses of such technologies, agencies must: 
** Solicit comment through their Open Government Webpage at www.[agency].gov/open for a minimum of 30 days. This notice and comment
must include the agency’s proposal to use such technologies and a description of how they will be used, which should at a minimum address the items in the Privacy Policy as described in Attachment 3; and
** Review and consider substantive comments and make changes to their intended use of web measurement and customization technologies where appropriate.
